# pyhf-benchmark

Benchmarking of hardware acceleration of `pyhf`

## Environment

For the time being, until a library can be created, use the `requirements.txt` to also serve setup duty in your virtual environment in addition to providing a reproducible benchmarking environment.

```
(pyhf-benchmark) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

First, users need to run `wandb` pakage locally using the following command. [Here](https://docs.wandb.com/self-hosted/local) is the configuration documentation.<br>

```
$ wandb local
```

```
Usage: run.py [OPTIONS]

  Automatic process of taking pyhf computation.

  Usage:

    $ python run.py [-b] [-p] [-u] [-m]

  Examples:

    $ python run.py -b numpy -u https://www.hepdata.net/record/resource/1267798?view=true -m [750,100]
    $ python run.py -u https://www.hepdata.net/record/resource/1267798?view=true -m [750,100]
    $ python run.py -b numpy -p 1Lbb-likelihoods-hepdata -m [750,100]

Options:
  -b, --backend TEXT      Name of the pyhf backend to run with.
  -p, --path TEXT         Local path of workspace.
  -u, --url TEXT          Online data link.
  -m, --model-point TEXT  Model point.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```
